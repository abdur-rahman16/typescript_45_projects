// Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, 
// but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them.
// The text of each message should be the same, 
// but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let arr2 = ["Farhan", "Owais", "Abdul Wahab", "Muneeb", "Fahad"];       //This one is better
for(let i = 0; i < arr2.length; i++){
    console.log(`Hey ${arr2[i]}, would you like to learn some JavaScript today?`);
};

// Shrinking Guest List: You just found out that your new dinner table won’t arrive in time for the dinner,
//  and you have space for only two guests.
// • Start with your program from Exercise 16. Add a new line that prints a message saying that you
//  can invite only two people for dinner.
// • Remove guests from your list one at a time until only two names remain in your list.
//  Each time you pop a name from your list, print a message to that person letting them know
//   you’re sorry you can’t invite them to dinner.
// • Print a message to each of the two people still on your list, letting them know they’re still invited.
// • Remove the last two names from your list, so you have an empty list.
// Print your list to make sure you actually have an empty list at the end of your program.
